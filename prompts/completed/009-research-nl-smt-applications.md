<research_objective>
Research and identify the top 10 most impactful applications of formal verification systems that extract SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) constraints from natural language and execute them for verification.

This research will inform Hupyy-PipesHub's positioning and help identify market opportunities for the natural language to SMT extraction technology.

Thoroughly explore academic papers, industry applications, and emerging use cases. Consider both current implementations and high-potential future applications.
